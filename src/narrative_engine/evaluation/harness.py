"""Masked-ending backtest harness (T1; design doc Sec 6.6).

Assembles the loop around the data-layer masking primitives:

    snapshot corpus at cutoff -> retrieve analogs -> generate theses ->
    score against ground truth -> compare against baselines.

Test cases are episodes that SPAN the cutoff (started before, resolved
after): at the cutoff they look exactly like a present-day query
(resolution=None by masking), but the true continuation is known and
scoreable.

Leakage canaries are enforced HERE as hard errors, not left to test code:
a backtest that silently read post-cutoff data is worse than no backtest,
because it produces a confident wrong number (Sec 6.6: "leakage remains
the single biggest threat to believing your own results").

Known residual leakage, stated honestly: masking controls what the SYSTEM
sees, not what the LLM remembers, and historians' prose was written with
hindsight. Score analog-selection quality separately from narrative
plausibility; prefer obscure test cases and post-training-cutoff events.
