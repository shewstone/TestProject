An **episode** is a self-contained historical situation with:
- A clear beginning (initiating conditions)
- A tension or conflict
- A resolution or ongoing development
- Specific actors and time period

**Instructions:**
1. Identify all distinct episodes in the text
2. For each episode, provide:
   - Episode number (1, 2, 3...)
   - One-line summary (20 words max)
   - Beginning state (what kicked it off)
   - Key tension (what's at stake)
   - Current status (resolved or ongoing)

**Output format:** Return JSON with this structure:
{{"episodes": [{{"number": 1, "summary": "...", "beginning": "...", "tension": "...", "status": "resolved|ongoing"}}]}}

2. **summary** (string): A 2-3 sentence summary of what happened

3. **actors** (array): List of significant actors with:
   - name: Actor name
   - role: Their role (e.g., "protagonist", "antagonist", "institution", "nation")
   
4. **setting** (object):
   - location: Where it took place
   - time_period: When (e.g., "1921-1923", "October 1929", "Q4 2008")
   - date_precision: "year", "month", "day", or "range"

5. **initiating_conditions** (array): What started this episode? (3-5 bullet points)

6. **escalation_mechanics** (array): How did tension build? What dynamics drove it? (3-5 bullet points)

7. **tension** (string): The core conflict or what's at stake (1 sentence)

8. **resolution** (string or null): How it ended, or "ongoing" if not resolved

9. **consequences** (array): What happened afterward? Immediate and downstream effects (3-5 bullet points)

**Standard narrative phases:**
- setup: Initial conditions, exposition
- rising_action: Building tension, escalation
- climax: Peak moment, turning point
- falling_action: Consequences unfold
- resolution: Final outcome, denouement

**Financial cycle phases (for credit_boom_and_bust):**
- boom: Expansion phase
- euphoria: Peak optimism, peak speculation
- distress: First signs of trouble
- panic: Crash, rapid decline
- revulsion: Despair, avoidance of asset class

**Instructions:**
1. Identify the PRIMARY arc type (most dominant pattern)
2. Identify the current phase in that arc
3. Consider if secondary arcs apply (episodes often instantiate multiple patterns)
4. Provide confidence score (0.0-1.0) and rationale
