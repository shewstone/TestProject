"""Controlled actor-role vocabulary (T2, docs/tickets/T2-structural-render-hardening.md).

Roles name STRUCTURAL POSITIONS, not costumes (design doc Sec 10.1): a
"court" is any power center where proximity to a principal outweighs formal
office — an administration's inner circle, a founder-CEO's kitchen cabinet,
a politburo. Admission test per role: would two episodes a thousand years
apart share this token in a way that reveals shape?

The vocabulary is deliberately small (~50, never past ~80): roles that
appear once never form clusters, and the entire point is forcing analogous
actors across millennia into the same token. It is versioned like the
taxonomy; actors that fit no role well accumulate as residue
(taxonomy.residue), which is the input signal for the Sec 10.5
vocabulary-evolution loop.

Roles can be filled by collective actors (an investor syndicate as
KINGMAKER, a movement as PRETENDER) — extraction prompts say so explicitly,
or the vocabulary only spots roles wearing individual faces (Sec 10.1a).
