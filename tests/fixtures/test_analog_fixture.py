"""Analog-fixture gate (T1): does place-blind structural matching work at all?

For every hand-built cross-era pair, the partner must rank in the top-k
structural neighbors among all fixture episodes (59 alternatives including
30 same-era distractors). pair_recall@5 and MRR are printed on every run so
the history is greppable; the recall floor gates CI and BLOCKS
embedding-model and render-template upgrades (Sec 6.3).

The floor is a ratchet, not an aspiration: set from the observed baseline
minus slack, raised as the render improves. A floor that fails from day
one teaches everyone to ignore the gate.
