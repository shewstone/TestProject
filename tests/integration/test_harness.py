"""End-to-end masked-ending harness test (T1; design doc Sec 6.6).

Proves the snapshot -> retrieve -> forecast -> score loop runs, that
masked data is physically unreachable (post-cutoff episodes never enter
the DB; ongoing episodes carry no outcomes), and that the persistence
baseline is scored alongside every thesis.
