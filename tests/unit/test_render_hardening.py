"""Structural render hardening tests (T2, docs/tickets/T2-structural-render-hardening.md).

The render is the perceptual bottleneck of the discovery apparatus
(Sec 10): free-text roles and proper nouns leaking into the structural
embedding quietly break place-blind matching. These tests pin the
guarantee: no identity marker from the source record survives the render.
